        <p style="text-align:justify; font-style: oblique; height: 18;"><b></b>On February 19, 2014, one year after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date.
             At the time, it was the largest acquisition of a venture-capital-backed company in history. Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5,000% return on its initial investment. Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and, advised by Morgan Stanley, 
             an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton. Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.
             Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: oblique;height: 18;">While WhatsApp is best known for bringing private and secure messaging to people across the world, more people are using it as a way to connect with voice and video calls. 
            That’s why over the course of this year we’ve launched several improvements to calling on WhatsApp, for catching up with friends and family, colleagues and communities securely.
            We’ve introduced new features for better connecting as a group on calls 32-person calls: You can now start a video or voice call on your mobile device with up to 32 people — four times the previous amount.</p>
